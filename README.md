Here are some source codes of the experiments of the course Object-Oriented Programming taught by Mr Qi Lin, Ocean University of Chain.

These source codes are for reference only. There may be some mistakes and I'd like you to tell me to make progress together.

These source codes include the common experiments and some special experiments which use the opencv etc.
